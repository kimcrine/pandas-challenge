Summary

In the Heros of Pymoli challenge, I was presented with a data set consisting of online game player purchase data. Throughout the challenge, I utilized the pandas library tools to create insightful data frames. I ran calculations to create a purchasing analysis based on gender  and age demographics, as well as obtain an organized list of the top spenders, most popular items, and most profitable items.

Conclusions

1) The game is largely dominated by male players (84.03%), while female players come in at 14.06%. 
2) The primary age group for players is 20-24 (44.79%), and the secondary player age group is 15-19 (18.58%).
3) The 20-24 age group also makes the most purchases out of all the age groups; however, their average total purchase per person ($4.32) is less than the 35-39 age group ($4.76). This could possibly mean that the older age group is willing to spend more on game purchases than the younger group.
4) There are 573 unique players listed in the data; however, there are a total of 780 purchases listed. This means there are several repeat buyers in the population.
5) Final Critic is both the most popular and the most profitable item for sale.
